## 📂 Projects
Here are a few of my notable projects that you can check out:

### 1. **[Predicting Used Car Prices](https://github.com/jayakanth45/Prediction-of-prices-for-used-cars)**  
  A machine learning model that predicts the price of used cars based on various features like brand, year of manufacture, mileage, and location. I used **Linear Regression** and **Random Forest Regressor** for this project.

### 2. **[Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/yourusername/MovieRecSystem)**  
  A recommendation system that uses **Collaborative Filtering** and **Content-Based Filtering** techniques to suggest movies to users based on their interests. The system is built using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Scikit-learn**.

### 3. **[GPA Calculator](https://github.com/jayakanth45/Gpa-calculator)**  
  A C++ based GPA calculator that helps students calculate their **Grade Point Average** based on their grades and credits for each subject.
